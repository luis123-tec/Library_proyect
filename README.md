Context
Imagine a small bookstore that is growing and needs an efficient way to manage its book inventory. Currently, they keep track of everything manually, which results in frequent errors, wasted time, and difficulties in knowing which books are in stock or need restocking. 

My proposition is a program that allows the bookstore to:

Register new books: Include title, year, stock quantity, price and author.
Update inventory: Modify the stock quantity when books are sold or new copies are added.
Register new mangas: Include volumes, score, title, price, stock
Aditionally, theres 2 types of users, employees and users, users may only see the available inventory, while employees can see it and modify it

This project is significant because it addresses a real problem: efficient inventory management. A good inventory system is important so customers can have all the necesary information on the books they want.

Solution:

To resolve this problem i got a lot of classes, the program has a menu, in which you can select what person you are, then you can choose from the options there, i used a variety of methods in the persona class, to make sure the program could differentiate the different types, also the class inventario was created to keep track of what the new books looked like, additionaly the methods in the producto class were made so you could also get information on the different types
