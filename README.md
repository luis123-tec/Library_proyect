# Small library manager
Proyect repository
Context
Imagine a small bookstore that is growing and needs an efficient way to manage its book inventory. Currently, they keep track of everything manually, which results in frequent errors, wasted time, and difficulties in knowing which books are in stock or need restocking. 

My proposition is a program that allows the bookstore to:

Register new books: Include title, author, genre, stock quantity, and price.
Update inventory: Modify the stock quantity when books are sold or new copies are added.
Search for books: By title, author, or genre.
Also it will not be limited by books, but other different media pieces can be added.

This project is significant because it addresses a real problem: efficient inventory management. A good inventory system is important so customers can have all the necesary information on the books they want.

Overall i think it can be a simple proyect, but i can develop it further so it adapts to all the topics required
